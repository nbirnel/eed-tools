NAME
       eed-tools- tools for manipulating electronic evidence discovery files

SYNOPSIS
       This  is	 a  collection of tools for manipulating files used by various
       EED programs.  None of the tools do any discovery — they merely process
       lfp,  dii,  opt, and other files generated by Ipro, Summation, Relativ‐
       ity, or Concordance.  These are largely not portable, and  need	to  be
       run under Cygwin.

       b2gb - convert bytes to gigabytes
       catalog - print file extensions of all files in current directory

       coloryank - copy jpgs from a build to a color directory
       count-iocr - provide ocr stats from IPRO ecap ocr summaries
       debom - remove byte order mark
       denativemeta - empty NATIVE_FILE in metadata records without slipsheets
